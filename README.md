- 👋 Hi, I’m @keerilynn (Keeri Tramm)
- 👀 I’m interested in all things data and accessibility.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full stack web development so I can display the data I work on even more!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects. I'm brand new to this so looking to help with documentation.
- 📫 Send me a github message or DM me on twitter @LynnKeeri
- 😻 My biggest interest in accessibility. I have several certifications in it and am working towards my full WAS certification. I currently serve as a board member of MN-NEAT, an assistive tech non-profit, and am a council member of the Minnesota Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities, where we lobby & advocate for accessiblity.

Cheers 🥂
